# Svelte + Rollup + WindiCSS + svelte-navigator

This template should help get you started developing with Svelte in Rollup with WindiCSS integration. This is based on https://github.com/lamualfa/svelte-windicss-preprocess-testing-v3.git

## Recommended IDE Setup

[VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [Svelte](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=svelte.svelte-vscode).

## Need an official Svelte framework?

Check out [SvelteKit](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit#readme), which is also powered by Vite. Deploy anywhere with its serverless-first approach and adapt to various platforms, with out of the box support for TypeScript, SCSS, and Less, and easily-added support for mdsvex, GraphQL, PostCSS, Tailwind CSS, and more.
